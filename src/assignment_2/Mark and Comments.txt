Game behaves according to specification (checked with file of duplicate words provided - bug.txt)

correct number of words falling 1/1

stops at maximum number of words (=caught + missed).  Checked with all caught and all missed and a combination.        3/3

words fall at different speeds 1/1

words disappear when hit bottom and score updated correctly 1/1

words disappear when typed and score updated correctly    2/2

incorrectly typed words are ignored 1/1

With duplicate words, only one disappears when typed correctly (not all, does not matter which one).       1/1

End button stops game and clears screen   1/1

Start button correctly restarts game   1/1

Pause/halt button works correctly     0/1

Quit button works correctly   1/1

Message on user's performance at end of game  1/1

Code Requirements

Model-View-Controller pattern followed - separating the view  from the data from the controller.  Controllers should be separate threads - not part of the data. e.g. WordRecord should not implement runnable.   5/5

Animation should be done by making JPanel runnable.  No Swing violations - accessing Swing components from other threads.  Alternative designs possible.   2/2

Should have synchronization all getter and setters of  for shared variables, e.g.  WordRecord and Score.  If not, there must be a very good reason why not.   3/3

Documentation

New classes or class modifications documented and explained.  3/3

Concurrency features used and why there were necessary.  Should list all different types of threads and synchronized classes.         3/3

Thread safety - possible data races identified (shared variables)  and explanation of why they are prevented.     3/3

Thread synchronization:  how was it ensured that all threads start at once?  2/2

Liveness is the responsiveness of the application - there should be some explanation of how this was ensured (not one thread doing everything etc.)   2/2

Deadlock:  should explain that deadlock can't occur if only one lock acquired at once.  2/2

Explanation of how the system conform to model-view-controller pattern - threads should mostly distinct from the data/view.   2/2

Explanation of how the system was validated - how were errors were checked for? 1/3

Donâ€™t have to be thread related, but they need to improve the game, not just the appearance.  5/5
